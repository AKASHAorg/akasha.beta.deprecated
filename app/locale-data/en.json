You are aware that AKASHA is a decentralized application and that, consequently, content published on AKASHA is not under control of any legal entity or private individual. Accordingly, you may not fully delete any content published from the AKASHA Platform. When you remove content, your content is only delisted which makes it more difficult to be found for others. However, you understand that removed content persist without any time limitation and may still be available to others.</p>\n                      <p>10. When you publish content using the setting “No rights reserved” in the License Option, it means that you are allowing everyone to access and use that content, to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture) and that you wave all your rights, including copyrights and related rights, to this content.</p>",

  "app.terms.gasDeductionBody": "<p>14. When creating an Identity on AKASHA, you will be provided with an Ethereum Address (Ethereum Identity Key) to which you will need to make a transfer of a small amount of Ether (ETH). The Ethereum Identity Key contains a pre-set functionality to deduct from your Identity Key Balance an AKASHA Gas Deduction, which is triggered by every transaction you make on AKASHA. The amount of ETH on your Ethereum Identity Key Balance remains always in your sole control and may be withdrawn any time.

You must keep this password safe and may not share it with anybody. </p>\n              <p>17 When logging in you have an option to create a secure “authentication hash/token” for a amount of time in your choice, which allows you to securely sign transactions while logged in without having to reintroduce your password each time you post, comment or vote on something (Open Login Function). When the selected time period expires, you will be prompted to reintroduce your password. Please assure that you do not leave your AKASHA access device unattended after having chosen the Open Login Function.</p>",
  "app.terms.risksTitle": "8. Risks",
  "app.terms.risksBody": "<p>18. You understand and accept the risks in connection with using AKASHA and transferring ETH to the Deposit Wallet as exemplary set forth hereinafter. In particular, but not concluding, you understand the inherent risks listed hereinafter:\n              <ul>\n              <li>Risk of software weaknesses: You understand and accept that AKASHA, the smart contract system concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) is still in an early development stage and unproven, why there is no warranty that              AKASHA will run uninterrupted or error-free and why there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of your profile and/or ETH submitted by you to the Deposit Wallet.</li>\n              <li>Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on, or introduce new regulations addressing, blockchain technology based                applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of AKASHA and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications of the AKASHA, including its termination and the loss of ETH submitted by you to the Deposit Wallet.</li>\n              <li>Risk of abandonment / lack of success: You understand and accept that the development of AKASHA beyond the Beta Version may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by      competing projects).</li>\n              <li>Risk of theft: You understand and accept that the AKASHA smart contract concept, the underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals that that could result in theft or loss of ETH          submitted by you to the Deposit Wallet.</li>\n              <li>Risk of Ethereum mining attacks: You understand and accept that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for AKASHA is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race      condition attacks.</li>\n              <li>Risk of new version: You understand and accept that the network of miners will be ultimately in control of AKASHA. You understand that a majority of these miners could agree at any point to make changes to the official AKASHA network and to run the new version of the smart contract system.</li></ul></p>",
