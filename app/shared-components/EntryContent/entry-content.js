          The odorous smell of mold and mildew hits you like a brick wall when you step
          through the front doors at Spain Elementary-Middle School in Detroit.

          I have been at Spain for 19 years, first as a first-grade teacher, then,
          after earning a masterâ€™s degree in counseling, as a school counselor. When I
          first started, it was a school any city would be proud to have in its
          district.
